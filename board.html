                            Brian is from Chicago and is a Junior in Silliman majoring in humanities. Brian does everything under the sun, but his most rewarding activity besides Bridges ESL is Link New Haven, which operates a free community resource desk in New Haven Green every week. He also loves endless conversations, any sport that involves running and learning new words. Brian is doing Bridges because when his mother migrated from Mexico, she had a difficult time overcoming the language barrier. In high school, teaching his mother English sparked within him a passion for spreading the gift of literacy. He joined Bridges his first semester on campus, and he will continue being involved with the organization until his last. Tutoring for Bridges is always the highlight of his week, and he can't stop telling people about his wonderful experience!

Over his four years in Bridges, he has loved seeing the progress and passion for learning among students, as well as being witness to the strong support systems fostered by Yale's community. Ignacio is excited to see both new and returning tutors help welcome students into the family. Outside of Bridges, he enjoys trying new foods, working out whenever possible, hanging out at cute cafes, going for walks in East Rock, and spending time with friends.

In addition to her involvement with Bridges, Tiffany is active in several service clubs on campus, including HAPPY, the Red Cross Club, and the Nourish Project. Recently, she has also begun exploring Chinese traditional dance. In her free time, Tiffany enjoys engaging in arts and crafts.

As the daughter of immigrants, she has dedicated much of her organizing work to supporting migrant communities both in the U.S. and abroad. Having been with Bridges for three years, she is continually impressed by the supportive community built within the classes. For her, organizations like this are essential in opening up educational opportunities for local New Haven migrants. In addition to her work with Bridges, she serves as an interpreter for Haven Clinic, is a student assistant for the EDST department, and a choreographer for Ballet Folklorico Mexicano de Yale. If she's ever missing, you'll most likely find her sunbathing at the farm.

                            Linda Do is a sophomore in Pierson studying Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry. Originally from Fresno, CA. Linda decided to join Bridges because she experienced first-hand the difficulty of trying to learn a new language. Linda, while trying to learn Vietnamese, realized that there weren't many online resources in English available for learning Vietnamese. She was eventually able to learn Vietnamese through conversing with her parents, and realized then how invaluable practicing with native speakers was to improving one's language skills. Linda now wants to help English learners in return and support their language learning journey. Since joining Bridges ESL, she has enjoyed hearing about people's experiences around the world. In her free time, Linda likes to take walks (when it's warm enough outside for a Californian), go down Wikipedia rabbit holes, and think about foods she'd like to try. On campus, Linda is involved in the Vietnamese Student Association (VISA), Southeast Asian Movement (SEAM) and Yale Grammatical Diversity Project (YGDP; I.e., linguistics research on varieties of English spoken in North America). She also volunteers at HAVEN—and of course, Bridges ESL!
